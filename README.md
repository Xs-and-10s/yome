# yome

So, what *is* a yome?... I'm not an expert, but my initial thought is something like... yome = dome * wigwam.  If you want to know more, I'd start here: http://rigsomelight.com/2015/06/09/straightforward-live-functional-javascript-building-the-yome-widget.html (or google it?).

That link is to a post from Bruce Hauman's blog where he... wait for it... builds a yome widget.  In this repo I'm just walking through his steps - it might be worthwhile for you to try it too (rather than just reading the post), and you might really enjoy it.  He's a great programmer, the author of Figwheel, and a clear communicator; well worth following.  The original repo for yome is here: https://github.com/bhauman/javascript_yome_widget.
